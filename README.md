# Automated-Document-Based-Data-Verification-System-Using-YOLOv8-and-Tesseract
This project focuses on automating the extraction of details such as Name, Board of Education, and more from scanned documents. By leveraging Tesseract OCR, an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool, and implementing various computer vision techniques, we have developed an effective solution for this task.
