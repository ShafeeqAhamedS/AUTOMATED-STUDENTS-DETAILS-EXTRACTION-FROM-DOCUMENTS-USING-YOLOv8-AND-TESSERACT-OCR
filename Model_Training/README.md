## YOLOv8 Object Detection Model Training

Welcome to the training model page of our project. In this document, we'll provide you with an overview of the YOLOv8 object detection model, explain the dataset, and guide you through the training process.


## YOLOv8 Overview

YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. It provides real-time and accurate object detection by dividing an image into a grid and making predictions for objects within each grid cell. YOLOv8 is a versatile framework, and in this project, we've trained a custom YOLOv8 model for the specific task of detecting "Register-Number" and "Subject-Code" within exam answer sheets.
